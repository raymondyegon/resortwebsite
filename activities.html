    <h3>MEETINGS AND EVENTS</h3>
    <p id=actvities>We have the expertise, facilities, and hi-tech amenities to organize conferences, meetings, and seminars in a choice of three versatile, multi-function rooms that can be connected to form one expansive hall. The rooms can be set up in a number of different ways including a classroom, theatre, or U-shape boardroom style. A full range of audio-visual and PA equipment is also readily available. Alternatively, our meeting rooms can be combined and transformed into a large function room, which, adjoining our open-air pool terrace, is the perfect venue for private parties, barbeque dinners, reunion celebrations, weddings, receptions, coffee breaks, and sit-down events for up to 250 guests. Moreover, we have the facilities for live bands, DJs, classical entertainment, traditional ‘Rindik’ music, and Balinese dance performances. Lastly, Bali accommodation has a team of professional event planners who will help you create unforgettable occasions.</p><br>
